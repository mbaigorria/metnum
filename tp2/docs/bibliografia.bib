@Inproceedings {TeleParam,
abstract     = {<p>PageRank computes the importance of each page in a directed graph under a
                random surfer model governed by a teleportation parameter. Commonly denoted
                alpha, this parameter models the probability of following an edge inside the
                graph or, when the graph comes from a network of web pages and links, clicking a
                link on a web page. We empirically measure the teleportation parameter based on
                browser toolbar logs and a click trail analysis. For a particular user or
                machine, such analysis produces a value of alpha. We find that these values
                nicely fit a Beta distribution with mean edge-following probability between 0.3
                and 0.7, depending on the site. Using these distributions, we compute PageRank
                scores where PageRank is computed with respect to a distribution as the
                teleportation parameter, rather than a constant teleportation parameter. These
                new metrics are evaluated on the graph of pages in Wikipedia.</p>},
